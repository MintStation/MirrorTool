<img src="https://github.com/MintStation/Mint-Documentation/blob/master/assets/mirrortool_logo.svg"/>

A tool for moving PRs from one repository to another. It is similar to this [yogstation13/MirrorBot](https://github.com/yogstation13/MirrorBot), but unlike it, it doesn't require constant work to track changes, but simply moves the PR from some date.

# Installation

1. Install python including pip.
2. Clone this somewhere and install PyGithub from pip `pip install pygithub`
3. Fill in `config.py`.
4. Run `python main.py`.
